# Employee Management API

## Overview
This API provides CRUD operations for managing employees in a company.

## Authentication
To access the API, you must first authenticate to receive a token.

### Authenticate
- **Endpoint**: `/api/auth`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Request Body**:
    ```json
    {
      "username": "your_username",
      "password": "your_password"
    }
    ```
- **Response**:
    ```json
    {
      "access_token": "your_jwt_token"
    }
    ```

## API Endpoints

### Create Employee
- **Endpoint**: `/api/employees/`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Request Body**:

      "department": "Engineering",
      "role": "Developer"
    }
    ```
- **Response**: `201 Created` with employee details.

### List Employees

## Running the Project Locally
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

### Run the application:   
python app.py

### Testing
python -m unittest test_app.py

### Summary

You now have a complete REST API for managing employees with the following features:

- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, Delete employees.
- **RESTful Principles**: Proper use of HTTP methods and status codes.
- **Authentication**: Token-based authentication using JWT.
- **Validation and Error Handling**: Ensures data integrity

### Enhancements and Considerations
Error Handling:

Ensure that you handle various error cases gracefully. For instance, if the email is already taken during employee creation, return a 400 Bad Request with a meaningful message.
You can create a custom error handler in Flask to manage these cases.
@app.errorhandler(400)
def bad_request(error):
    return jsonify({"error": "Bad Request", "message": str(error)}), 400

@app.errorhandler(404)
def not_found(error):
    return jsonify({"error": "Not Found", "message": str(error)}), 404

Environment Variables:
Instead of hardcoding sensitive information like the JWT secret key, consider using environment variables. You can use the python-dotenv package to load environment variables from a .env file.
pip install python-dotenv

Then, create a .env file:
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_jwt_secret_key

Update your config.py to load these variables:
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os

load_dotenv()

class Config:
    SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'sqlite:///employees.db'
    SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS = False
    JWT_SECRET_KEY = os.getenv('JWT_SECRET_KEY')

### Rate Limiting:
Implement rate limiting to protect your API from abuse. You can use the Flask-Limiter extension.    
pip install Flask-Limiter

Then, set it up in your app.py:
from flask_limiter import Limiter

limiter = Limiter(app, key_func=get_remote_address)

@app.route('/api/employees/', methods=['POST'])
@limiter.limit("5 per minute")  # Limit to 5 requests per minute
@jwt_required()
def create_employee():
    ...

### CORS Support:
If you plan to access your API from a web application hosted on a different domain, consider enabling CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing).
pip install flask-cors

Then, add it to your app:
from flask_cors import CORS

CORS(app)

### Logging:
Implement logging to keep track of requests and errors. Use Python's built-in logging module to log important events.
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

@app.before_request
def log_request_info():
    app.logger.info('Request: %s %s', request.method, request.url)

### Deployment Considerations
Deployment:
When you're ready to deploy your API, consider using platforms like Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean. Each platform has its own setup process.
Make sure to configure your production database and environment variables accordingly.

Database Migration:
If you make changes to your database models in the future, use Flask-Migrate to handle database migrations.
flask db init
flask db migrate
flask db upgrade

### Final Review and Testing
Review the Code:
Go through your code to ensure that it adheres to best practices, such as naming conventions, code organization, and comments.

Run All Tests:
Make sure to run all tests again after implementing any changes to ensure everything works as expected.
python -m unittest discover

Postman Collection:
Consider creating a Postman collection for your API endpoints. This will help others (or yourself in the future) to easily test the API.

Conclusion:
The Employee Management API project successfully implements a robust RESTful API for managing employee data using Flask and SQLAlchemy. It features essential CRUD operations, JWT-based authentication for security, and thorough error handling. With built-in data validation, comprehensive unit tests, and clear documentation, this API is designed for efficiency and maintainability.
